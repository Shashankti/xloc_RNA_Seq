# xloc_RNA_Seq
Contains the files and scripts used for RNA-Seq analysis 
## Scripts
1. Deseq2.R
 -> used to run Deseq2 on the 'gene_numreads.tsv' file
 -> The outputs are annotated with gene names and contain 3 comparisions

2. Plots.R
 -> Used to generate volcano plots and heatmaps for different conditions
 -> Also contains neighbour gene analysis

3. Enrichment_analysis.R
 -> GO enrichment analysis
 -> GSEA plots
 -> Change the input file at the start for different comparisions


## Plots

* contain all output plots from DESeq2 and GO/GSEA

## Data

* contains the input data for DESeq2

## Analysis

* contains the output for DEGs
